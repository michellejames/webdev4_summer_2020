Expand your website from last weeks homework and add accessibility features. Also, add in feedback you’ve received during class. 
If not already responsive, make your site responsive and use semantic HTML elements wherever it makes sense.

In addition to your landing page, add one subpage. The topic of the subpage is up to you. I’m suggesting a product page to be able to work with different links or a contact page, that includes an input field.

At a minimum, your site should include:
A Name field
An Email field
At least one set of radio buttons
At least one checkbox
At least one expandable text area
All inputs should have an associated label

The entire site should be navigable with keyboard only, and each field should be clearly described when read by a screen reader.
Your site must have no warnings or errors using accessibility validation chrome extension that we looked at in class.

You will be graded on the correct usage of tools to help you achieve good usability.

Bonus points if you are able to implement a “Skip to Main Content” button.
